# Georgia Homeschool Platform

A secure, AI-enhanced learning management and analytics platform for Georgia homeschool stakeholders (students, teachers, parents).

## Foundation-First Approach
This repository was initialized with security, observability, and governance artifacts *before* feature implementation.

## Core Principles
- Traceability by default (every execution has a trace ID)
- Principle of least privilege (role-based access from Sprint 1)
- Deterministic releases (signed manifest + SBOM)
- Threat modeling as a living artifact
- AI prompt security controls (segmentation, injection countermeasures)
- Failure harvesting → resilience patterns

## High-Level Architecture (Initial)
Frontend (React/Next.js) → Backend API (Node/TypeScript) → Auth (Firebase) → Execution Registry (Firestore) → AI Orchestrators (LLM provider) → Observability (structured logs, metrics)

## Early Roadmap
| Phase | Theme | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Foundation | Docs + Security Skeleton | In Progress |
| Auth & Roles | Role claim issuance + RBAC | Pending |
| Traceability | Registry + Middleware | Pending |
| Validation | Schema & injection tests | Pending |

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run bootstrap   # if using workspaces
cp .env.example .env
```

## Scripts (Planned)
- `manifest:generate` – Produce release-manifest.json + hash
- `security:scan` – SBOM + dependency audit
- `test:security` – Injection + misuse tests

## Contributing
All PRs must include:
- Updated threat model (if attack surface changes)
- OWASP matrix delta (if new risk introduced)
- Trace coverage (if new execution flows added)

## License
TBD (MIT or Apache 2 recommended)
