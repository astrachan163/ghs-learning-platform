# ADR-0001: Initialize with Foundation-First Structure

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Prototype repos lacked early security artifacts → risk of “bridge” classification in academic review.

## Decision
Create new repository with all governance, threat, observability, and security placeholders before any business logic.

## Consequences
+ Strong admissions & professional narrative.
- Slower first feature commit (intentional).

## Security Considerations
Shift-left threat modeling feasible; reduces retrofitting cost.
