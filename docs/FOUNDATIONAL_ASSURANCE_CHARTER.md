# Foundational Assurance Charter

## Objective
Demonstrate proactive mastery of secure software engineering fundamentals and AI orchestration safeguards from day zero.

## Pillars
| Pillar | Artifacts |
|--------|-----------|
| Traceability | `middleware/trace.ts`, `services/orchestrationRegistry.ts` |
| Input Integrity | `middleware/validate.ts`, `schemas/*.ts` |
| Cryptographic Literacy | `security/crypto_examples.ts` |
| Threat Modeling | `docs/threat-models/*.md` |
| Deployment Integrity | `scripts/generate-release-manifest.sh` |
| Supply Chain Security | `sbom.json`, CI audit |
| RBAC & Access Control | `services/roles.ts`, `middleware/auth.ts` |
| Prompt Security | `docs/methods/prompt-security.md` |
| Incident Readiness | `docs/ir/runbook.md`, `docs/incident-simulations.md` |

## Success Criteria
- All execution flows carry a trace ID by first functional release.
- 100% of external input paths validated via schema.
- Threat model updated in each structural PR.
- Release manifests signed & stored hash.
- OWASP matrix covers all implemented surface areas.
